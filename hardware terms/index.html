<h1>Hardware Terms</h1>
<h2>input device</h2>
<p>a input device is a kind of peripheral. It is used to provide data and control signals directly to a information processing system. Examples of a input devices are mice, keybords, mics, ect.</p>
<h2>output device</h2>
<p>A output device is any piece of the computer hardwere equipment which converts the information readable for humans. For example your monitor, speakers, or printers are output devices.</p>
<H2>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</H2>
<P>The central processing unit also known as the CPU is pretty much the brain of the CAD system. The CPU consists of a control unit, arithmetic and logic unit (ALU), and various registers.
<H2>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</H2>
<P>A Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a circuit used to perform logic and arithmetic operations. It is the building block of the central processing unit (CPU).</p>
<h2>Control Unit (CU)</h2>
	<p> The control unit is one of the components of the computeres CPU. It tells the computers ALU, memory, input and output devices how to respond to the instructions sent to the processer.</p>
<h2>Random Access Memory (RAM)</h2>
<p>RAM is the internal memory of the CPU. It is used for storing data.</p>
<h2>optical memory</h2>
<P>optical storage is any type of stroage which data is read by a laser. For example DVDs and CDs are types of optical storage.</p>
<h2>magnetic memory</h2>
<p>magnetic memory is the main way how data is stored on a magnetic medium</P>
	<h2> Flash memory </h2>
	<p> flash memory is something like a usb that you can plug into a computor to add store things</p>
	<h2> Logic Gates </h2>
	A logic gate is a idealized modle of computation. Logic gates do the basic functions, and are the building blocks of digital integrated circuits.
